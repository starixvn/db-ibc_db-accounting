	Task: Show Tickets Listing Detail and Export to excel for NAP system
	DB: DBACC/bodb02
	Original: Acc_Rpt_TicketsListingDetail

	Revisions:	
		- 20130911@Kathy: Rename parameter @SAFilter to @SecondAcceptFlag
		- 20131203@Kathy: Rename column: liveindicator to IsLiveIndicator.
						Using Dep_CustSuper table instead of f_DepSuper_1() function.		
		- 20140211@Kathy: Get more column for MixParlay	
		- 20150402@Dominic: Add new 60 bettypes [Redmine:#27214]
		- 20150623@Dominic: Add Metric Gaming Super Live [Redmine:##38200]	  
	Param's Explanation:
	- @Type: sports type
		0: Sportsbook
		1: Number Game
		2: Virtual sports
		3: Live casino
	- @LicenseeName:
		ALL, IBC, 12bet, ...	
	- @BetTypes: String of bettype for Sportsbook, virtual sports and for Dead Ball - Number game, Live casino
	- @BetTypesLive: String of bettype ONLY for Live - Number game 
	- @LiveType: Combo Type, used only for Sportsbook
		0: Dead ball
		1: Live ball
		2: All	
	- Because the interface is separated with sportbook and number game
		==>	SportsBook: Use @BetTypes and @LiveType to indicate Live ball or Dead ball
			Number game: Use @BetTypes and @BetTypesLive to indicate Live ball or Dead ball
			Virtual sports: Use @BetTypes to indicate Dead ball
    - @SecondAcceptFlag: 
      + 0: All tickets
      + 1: Normal tickets only
      + 2: SA tickets only	
     
   Example:    exec NAP_Rpt_TicketsListingDetail @MatchId=4626986,@LicenseeName='IBC',@BetTypes='1101,1102',@BetTypesLive='',@LiveType=0,@LiveHomeScore=default,@LiveAwayScore=default,@FromTransdate=default,@ToTransdate=default,@Type=2,@SecondAcceptFlag=0
